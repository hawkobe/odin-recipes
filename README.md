# odin-recipes

This is my first attempt at creating a website! I chose to do in on
Thanksgiving recipes, since it's right around the corner. I will be
showcasing the skills I have recently learned in the Odin Project 
Introduction to HTML lessons.

Some of the skills I will be putting into practice are:

- Setting up a repo on Github for the project (I imagine in if you're here, I did it right)
- Implementing file system organization to keep my files where they should be
- creating a homepage (index.html) for the website, along with other
web pages to link to it
- showing my knowledge of how an .html document is structured by 
correct formatting
- using different html elements I've learned so far, like creating
unordered and ordered lists, inserting images, and usings the correct head and heading sizes for my project
